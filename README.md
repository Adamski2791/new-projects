# New Python Code Beginner

Welcome to my "New Python Code Beginner" repository! This repository serves as a portfolio of my Python projects as I embark on my programming journey. I have recently completed a Python course over the past 8 weeks and am excited to continue honing my skills through various projects.

## About Me

I'm brand new to programming, and Python has been my first introduction to the world of coding. While I don't have any prior programming experience, I'm enthusiastic about learning and exploring the possibilities that Python offers. This repository will document my progress as I delve into different projects and demonstrate my growth as a beginner programmer.

## Project Updates

As I work on different projects, I will be uploading them to this repository to showcase my learning journey. Each project will have its own directory, containing the source code and any accompanying resources. I will strive to provide clear documentation within each project to explain its purpose, functionality, and any specific features or techniques I have implemented.

## Goals

My primary goal is to build a strong foundation in Python programming and develop my skills by working on diverse projects. Through this repository, I hope to create a portfolio that demonstrates my growth, showcases my projects, and serves as a testament to my dedication and progress as a beginner programmer.

## Contribution

While this repository primarily represents my personal projects and progress, I am open to constructive feedback, suggestions, and collaborations. If you come across any bugs, have ideas for improvements, or want to provide general advice, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Your input and support are greatly appreciated!
